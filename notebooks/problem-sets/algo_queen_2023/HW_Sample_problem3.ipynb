    "## Half Adder\n",
    "The half adder is used to add together the two least significant digits in a binary sum.\n",
    "It has two single binary inputs, called A and B, and two outputs C (carry out) and S (sum).\n",
    "The output C will be used as an input to the Full Adder, which will be explained later, for obtaining the value in the higher digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Half adders can be described with the truth table shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "|A (input)|B (input)|S (sum)|C (carry out)|\n",
    "|-----------|------------|------------|------------|\n",
    "|0|0|0|0|\n",
    "|0|1|1|0|\n",
    "|1|0|1|0|\n",
    "|1|1|0|1|\n",
    "\n",
    "From the truth table, you should notice that the carry output, C, is a result of operating an AND gate against A and B, where the output S is a result of operating an XOR against A and B.\n",
    "As we have already created the AND and XOR gates, we can combine these gates and create a half adder as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make a QuantumCircuit of 4 quantum registers and 2 classical registers and assign inputs A and B to qubit 0 and qubit 1, the sum output S and carry output C to qubit 2 and qubit 3."
