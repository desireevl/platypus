    "In quantum computers, the job of the XOR gate is done by the ‘controlled-NOT gate’. Since that's quite a long name, we usually just call it the ‘CNOT’. In circuit diagrams, it is drawn as in the image below. This is applied to a pair of qubits. One acts as the control qubit (this is the one with the little dot). The other acts as the target qubit (with the big circle and cross - kind of like a target mark).\n",
